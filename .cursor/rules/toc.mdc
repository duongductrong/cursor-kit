You have multiple specialized rules:

- [TypeScript](./typescript.mdc) - TypeScript best practices and code style
- [Frontend Design Skills](./frontend-design-skills.mdc) - Frontend design skills and best practices
- [React](./react.mdc) - React component patterns and best practices
- [Testing](./testing.mdc) - Testing standards and patterns
- [Git](./git.mdc) - Git commit and branching conventions
- [Security](./security.mdc) - Security best practices
- [Coding Style](./coding-style.mdc) - Coding style and best practices
- [Performance](./performance.mdc) - Performance best practices

Guideline:

- For each user request, first decide which 0–3 rules are most relevant.
- Prefer the SINGLE most specific rule if there is overlap.
- If a question touches both security and performance, prioritize security.mdc first, then performance.mdc.
- If no rule clearly matches, ignore all rules and answer normally.
