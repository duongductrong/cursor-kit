Managing multiple Cursor IDE accounts is a common challenge for developers who work across different organizations, freelance projects, or need to separate personal and professional workflows. The **Cursor Kit `instance` command** provides a powerful solution that enables you to run multiple Cursor instances simultaneously on macOS.

## The Multi-Account Problem

Modern developers often face scenarios requiring multiple IDE accounts:

- **Enterprise vs Personal** — Using separate accounts for work and personal projects
- **Freelance Work** — Managing multiple client accounts with different access permissions
- **Team Collaboration** — Testing with different team member permissions
- **API Quotas** — Distributing AI assistant usage across multiple accounts

Without proper tooling, switching between accounts requires logging out and back in—a frustrating workflow that breaks your concentration.

## Introducing Cursor Kit Instance

Cursor Kit's `instance` command creates isolated copies of Cursor IDE, each with its own identity and data directory. This means you can:

- Run multiple Cursor windows with different logged-in accounts
- Keep extensions and settings separate per instance
- Preserve all configurations when Cursor updates
- Create shell aliases for quick access

## Getting Started

First, install Cursor Kit globally:

```bash
npm install -g cursor-kit-cli
```

Then create your first instance:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Work"
```

This command performs several operations behind the scenes:

1. Creates a copy of Cursor.app in `~/Applications/`
2. Assigns a unique bundle identifier (e.g., `com.cursor.cursorwork`)
3. Creates a separate data directory in `~/Library/Application Support/`
4. Re-signs the app with an ad-hoc signature

## Creating Shell Aliases

One of the most powerful features is the ability to create shell aliases. Just like the `cursor` command opens files in Cursor, you can create custom commands for each instance:

```bash
# Create instance with alias in one command
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Work" -A cursor-work

# Or add an alias to an existing instance
cursor-kit instance -a alias -n "Cursor Work" -A cursor-work
```

Now you can open projects directly in your work instance:

```bash
cursor-work ~/projects/enterprise-app
cursor-work .  # Open current directory
```

### Alias Storage Options

Choose where to store your aliases based on your preferences:

| Location | Path | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| `shell-config` | `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` | Most users (restart terminal to activate) |
| `home-bin` | `~/bin/` | Users with custom bin paths |
| `usr-local-bin` | `/usr/local/bin/` | System-wide access |

Specify your preferred location:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Work" -A cursor-work --aliasLocation shell-config
```

## Managing Your Instances

### List All Instances

View all your configured instances and their aliases:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -l
```

Output:

```text
● Cursor Enterprise (alias: cursor-work)
  └─ ~/Applications/Cursor Enterprise.app
● Cursor Personal (alias: cursor-personal)
  └─ ~/Applications/Cursor Personal.app
```

### Reinstall After Updates

When Cursor releases an update, your instances need to be refreshed. The reinstall command preserves your data and settings:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a reinstall -n "Cursor Work"
```

This ensures you always have the latest Cursor features while maintaining your separate instances.

### Remove an Instance

Clean up instances you no longer need:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a remove -n "Cursor Work"
```

You'll be prompted to also remove the associated shell alias.

## Real-World Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow for a developer managing enterprise and personal projects:

```bash
# Step 1: Create enterprise instance
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Enterprise" -A cursor-enterprise

# Step 2: Create personal instance
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Personal" -A cursor-personal

# Step 3: Open projects in the appropriate instance
cursor-enterprise ~/work/enterprise-saas
cursor-personal ~/personal/side-project

# Step 4: After Cursor updates, reinstall instances
cursor-kit instance -a reinstall -n "Cursor Enterprise"
cursor-kit instance -a reinstall -n "Cursor Personal"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

Choose instance names that clearly indicate their purpose:

```bash
# Good
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor Client ABC"
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor OpenSource"

# Avoid
cursor-kit instance -a create -n "Cursor 2"
```

### 2. Consistent Alias Naming

Use a consistent pattern for aliases that's easy to remember:

```bash
cursor-work      # Work projects
cursor-personal  # Personal projects
cursor-client-x  # Specific client
```

### 3. Document Your Setup

Keep track of your instances in your dotfiles or notes:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or documentation
# Cursor Instances:
# - cursor-enterprise: Work account (org@company.com)
# - cursor-personal: Personal account (me@gmail.com)
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

After each Cursor update, remember to reinstall your instances:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a reinstall -n "Cursor Enterprise"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Instance Won't Launch

If an instance fails to open after a Cursor update:

```bash
cursor-kit instance -a reinstall -n "Your Instance Name"
```

### Alias Not Working

Ensure your shell configuration is sourced:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # For zsh users
source ~/.bashrc # For bash users
```

### Permission Issues

For `/usr/local/bin/` aliases, you may need sudo:

```bash
sudo cursor-kit instance -a alias -n "Instance" -A alias-name --aliasLocation usr-local-bin
```

## Conclusion

Cursor Kit's `instance` command transforms how you work with multiple Cursor accounts. By creating isolated instances with custom shell aliases, you can seamlessly switch between different contexts without logging in and out.

Whether you're managing enterprise and personal projects, working with multiple clients, or simply want to organize your development workflows, this feature provides the flexibility you need.
